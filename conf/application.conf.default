# Mailbox Service
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# Mailbox Service fetches and process mails from IMAP server. For example, if

#
# If you want to use this feature, your IMAP server has to be configured to
# support the address alias using '+' sign, also known as 'subaddressing' or
# 'detailed addressing'. For example, emails to 'yona+issue@yourmail.com' have
# to be delivered to 'yona@yourmail.com'.
#
# SECURITY WARNING: Yona believes the email address in From header of the
# received email is truthful and use it for authentication without doubt. To
# avoid this problem, your imap server must deny every email whose From header
# is forged.
#
# Here is an example if you use Gmail.
#
# Set imap.use to true if you want to use this feature.
