# Using issues

Many tasks exist when projects are ongoing. For managing and tracing these tasks, Yobi provides you a solution, `Issues`.

You can share problems and tasks with project members by creating issues and assign issues to them. You can also manage schedule by using `Milestone`.


Creating new issues
-------------------

1. Go to a project in which you want to make an issue.
1. Click the `New issue` button.
1. Fill out the forms and then click the `Save` button.

### Assignee

You can choose an assignee on the issue.

1. Click the `Assignee` drop down box on the right of the issue page.
1. You will see project members.
1. Click a member to which you want to assign the issue

To assign an issue to a member means that the member should solve the issue. 

Issues are filtered by project member names on `Issues` page.

### Milestones

You can do schedule management after assigning milestones to issues.
